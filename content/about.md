### Our Mission
Education has always been of paramount importance to not just the survival but also the growth of human beings. Therefore, the world has seen a great surge in the number of institutions, sources and resources of knowledge more than it has ever before in the known history. But just like virtually anything in the world, education has attracted a great deal of inauthenticity as it has been gaining a lot of traction. Hence people started using the phrases like "true education" or "true knowledge". There is no need to invent new words for the old concepts. Education is the true education. Knowledge is the true knowledge. You just have to do it right!

Here at Taswiya, we embarked on a mission of bringing back those old perls of education that elevates the educated. We're primarily focused on concrete sciences and software engineering. Our well-thought-out curriculum allows us to inspire and promote students to master and get the full grasp of sciences. Our library has no shortage of quality books and papers.
